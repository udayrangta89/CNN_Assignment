# Project Name
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- We are building a CNN model which can accurately detect melanoma.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## Conclusions
- adam optimized worked better than sgd for this assignment
- Data augmentation can help with reducing the gap between training and validation accuracy in case of overfitting
- Class imblances can be rectified with Augmentor library
- Augmentor approrach to generate more training data, enhances the accuracy greatly.
- We can try different options of adding/removing layers, regularizations, to make the complex perform better.
